# Calculator Project Documentation

## Introduction
The calculator project is a simple application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The calculator has a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to input numbers and perform operations.

# Installation and Running the Calculator Application

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have a **Windows/Linux/Mac** machine running the latest version of **Python** (replace with your actual requirements).

## Installing the Calculator Application
To install the Calculator Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd <project_directory>`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (replace with your actual command).

## Running the Calculator Application
To run the Calculator Application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the application using `python main.py` (replace with your actual command).

You should now be able to see the calculator application running in your terminal.






# Using the Calculator Application

1. **Start the Application**: Run the application as per the instructions in the installation guide. You should see a user interface with buttons for numbers 0-9 and operations like add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/).

2. **Input Numbers**: Click on the buttons for numbers to input the first number of your calculation.

3. **Choose an Operation**: Click on the button for the operation you want to perform.

4. **Input the Second Number**: Click on the buttons for numbers to input the second number of your calculation.

5. **Calculate**: Press the equals (=) button to calculate the result. The result will be displayed on the screen.

6. **Clear the Calculator**: If you want to perform a new calculation, press the clear (C) button to reset the calculator.

Remember, this is a basic guide and the actual usage might vary depending on the specific features and user interface of your calculator application.







# Code Structure of the Calculator Project

The codebase of the calculator project is organized into several modules and classes:

## Modules

1. **main.py**: This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the calculator and starts the application.

2. **calculator.py**: This module contains the `Calculator` class which handles the logic of the calculator.

3. **gui.py**: This module contains the `GUI` class which handles the graphical user interface of the calculator.

## Classes

1. **Calculator**: This class is responsible for performing the arithmetic operations. It has methods like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.

2. **GUI**: This class is responsible for creating the user interface and handling user input. It uses a library like Tkinter to create the buttons and display for the calculator.

## Interaction

The `main.py` module creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and the `GUI` class. The `GUI` class takes the `Calculator` instance as an argument, so it can call the calculator's methods when a button is pressed.

When a user presses a button in the GUI, the corresponding method in the `Calculator` class is called. The result is then displayed on the screen.

## Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory. They test the individual methods of the `Calculator` class to ensure they return the correct results.
